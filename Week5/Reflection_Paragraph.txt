After diving into the techniques of style tiles and full comps I found my preference for the style tiles. I found this approach to be more open to creativity without the sense of permanence offered by a full comp. I felt that I could play around with texture, typography and design features without having to commit to the aftermath. The style tiles helped me progress in my ideas for my website as they weren't overly challenging to make and I was able to make more than one in the same amount of time it took me to create one full comp. I don't feel, however, that one can get by on just style tiling. I don't agree that Full Comps are a dying art and I feel they are a necessary step for tying all of your thoughts together. It's the style tiles that hash out the details and give you a vague sense of the vision you are trying to accomplish, however.
